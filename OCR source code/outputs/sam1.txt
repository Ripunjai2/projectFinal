One simple way to store information in these paper documents in to computer system 
is to first scan the documents and then store them as IMAGES. But to reuse this  
information it is very difficult to read the individual contents and 
searching the contents form these documents line-by-line and word-by-word. 
The reason for this difficulty is the font characteristics of the characters in paper 
documents are different to font of the characters in computer system. As a 
result, computer is unable to recognize the characters while reading them. 
This concept of storing the contents of paper documents in computer storage place 
and then reading and searching the content is called DOCUMENT
 PROCESSING. Sometimes in this document processing we need to process the 
information that is related to languages other than the English in the world. For this 
document processing we need a software system called CHARCATER RECOGNITION 
SYSTEM. This process is also called DOCUMENT IMAGE ANALYSIS (DIA).
